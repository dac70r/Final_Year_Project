# ELEC 4900 Final Year Project @ HKUST
This is my final year project folder. 

# Introduction 
This project features a Single Refreshable Braille Display that is controlled by a Field-Programmable Gate Array. 
The purpose of this project is to engineer a cheap and simple alternative to braille displays on the consumer market. While our display might not be as compact as other products on the market, it features a novel braille mechanism that is simple to manufacture. 

Our braille display was manufactured almost entirely out of plastic using a 3D printer in the university makerspace lab. Other components such as SG90 motors were also used to drive the braille mechanism itself. All of the components were fitted into 3D printed enclosure and sealed with a acrylic top cover with cutouts for the push buttons, switches and the braille pins.
