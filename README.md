# ELEC 4900 Final Year Project @ The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology
This is my final year project folder. 

# Introduction 
This project features a Single Refreshable Braille Display that is controlled by a Field-Programmable Gate Array. 
The purpose of this project is to engineer a cheap and simple alternative to braille displays on the consumer market. While our display might not be as compact as other products on the market, it features a novel braille mechanism that is simple to manufacture. 

Our braille display was manufactured almost entirely out of plastic using a 3D printing in the university makerspace lab. Other components such as SG90 motors were also used to drive the braille mechanism itself.
